/************
HTTP Review :
************/

-asymmetric request/response protocol
-stateless
-permits negotiating data types and representations
-uniform resource locator identifies resources over the internet, protocol://hostname:port/path

-HTTP usually runs on top of TCP/IP, but any reliable transport protocol can be used
-IP is a network layer protocol which deals with network addresses and routing
-TCP is a transport layer protocol which directs packets to the appropriate socket on the host and establishing connections between sockets

Request :
-requests consist of a message header and optional message body, separated by a blank line
-the message header has a request line and request headers
request line -> request-method request-uri http-version, e.g. GET /test.html HTTP/1.1
request headers -> one name: value pair per line, e.g. Host: www.xyz.com, Connection: Keep-Alive, Accept: image/gif, image/jpeg, */*, Accept-Language: us-en
request body -> optional block of text data

full e.g.

GET /doc/resource.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.imagehost.com
Accept: image/gih, */*
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0
Content-Length: 35

Response :
-responses consist of a message header and message body, seperated by a blank line
-message header consists of status line and response headers
status line -> http-version status-code reason-phrase, e.g. HTTP/1.1 200 OK, HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
response headers -> one name: value pair per line, e.g. Content-Type: text/html, Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=100
response body -> request data, e.g. html data

full e.g.

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: ...
Server: ...
Last-Modified: ...
Content-Type: text/html

<html> ... </html>

HTTP request methods (verbs) :
GET - ask for content
HEAD - message header (status and headers) that a GET request would have obtained
POST - send data to the server (create resource on the server in REST)
PUT - save data on the server (update data on the server in REST)
DELETE - delete data on server


Content Negotiation :

A client can use request headers like Accept, Accept-Language. Accept-Charset, Accept-Encoding to as for specific data formats, which the server will try to
satisfy. This is known as content negotiation.

Content-Type -> server uses MIME configuration file to map file extension and media type, e.g. .html is associated with text/html media type
Accept-Language -> servers may associate a language with files
Accept-Charset -> common character sets are UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, etc.
Accept-Encoding -> common encodings are x-gzip and x-compress


Persistent (Keep-alive) Connections :

In HTTP/1.0, the server closes the TCP connection after delivereing a response. This is inefficient since modern browers make many HTTP requests.
In HTTP/1.1 connections persist by default and the client may send ConnectionL Close to end the tcp connection


Cache-Control :

Cache-Control: no-cache tells a proxy to re-fetch the content


Caching :

As mentioned, Expires and Cache-control indicate to the client how to cache content.

Expires
-indicates that the content should be cached until the specified time.

Cache-control
-fine grained control
-max-age=<seconds> expiry time in seconds from now
-s-maxage=<seconds> shared cache expiry time in seconds from now
-public okay to cache authenticated content
-private only single user caches can store content
-no-cache client should reverify the state of the resource with an ETag or Last-modified header on each access
-no-store never cache
-overrides Expires
