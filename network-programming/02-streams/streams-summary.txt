/*************
Byte Streams :
**************/

// InputStream - abstract base class for input byte streams
// OutputStream - abstract base class for output byte streams

FileInputStream - byte stream from file (local encoding)
FileOutputStream - byte stream to file (assumes data is encoded using local encoding)

BufferedInputStream - buffers any input stream to limit I/O
BufferedOutputStream - buffers any output stream to limit I/O

/******************
Character Streams :
*******************/

// Reader - abstract base class for input character streams
// Writer - abstract base class for output character streams

// no need to wrap an explicit byte stream
FileReader - character stream from file (converts characters from local encoding to java primitive which is utf-16)
FileWriter - character stream to file (converts characters from java primitive which is utf-16 to local encoding)

InputStreamReader - bytes (local encoding) to characters
OutputStreamWriter - characters to bytes (local encoding)

BufferedReader - buffered input character stream
BufferedWriter - buffered output character stream

// any java type to formatted bytes (local encoding)
PrintStream - output byte stream

// java types to/from formatted characters
PrintReader - reads characters (local encoding) to java types
PrintWriter - writes java types to characters (local encoding)

// java primitives to raw binary (saving data)
DataInputStream - binary (JVM defined format) to primitives
DataOutputStream - primitives to binary (JVM defined format)
