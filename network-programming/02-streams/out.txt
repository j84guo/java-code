There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self.The world breaks everyone, and afterward, some are strong at the broken places.There is no hunting like the hunting of man, and those who have hunted armed men long enough and liked it, never care for anything else thereafter.Courage is grace under pressure.But man is not made for defeat. A man can be destroyed but not defeated.Happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know.There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.“Oh, Jake,” Brett said, “we could have had such a damned good time together.”…“Yes,” I said. “Isn’t it pretty to think so?”Always do sober what you said you'd do drunk. That will teach you to keep your mouth shut.There is no friend as loyal as a book.
