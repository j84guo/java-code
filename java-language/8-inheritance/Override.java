// Method overriding allows a child to change a method implementation from the parent's (if it's not final).
// Note that the signatures must be the same (same name different signature is overloading)

// Method overriding is the basis of dynamic dispatch.
// The specific implementation to execute is determined at runtime, based on what object the reference points to.
// Therefore polymorphism is possible by assigning references to subclasses to a variable of type superclass/interface
// and invoking some method with different implementations.
// Recall that the reference though must have that method in its interface first.
