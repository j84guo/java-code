Composite builds allow you to test libraries without re-publishing them after each change. This is useful in highly modular projects, like microservices.
use 

./gradlew build --include <path to build>

Gradle will fetch the jar's located at the specified path. If any dependencies in the composite project can be satisfied by the include build, gradle will 
substitute the local libraries.
