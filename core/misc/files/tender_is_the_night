Rosemary bubbled with delight at the trunks. Her naïveté responded
whole-heartedly to the expensive simplicity of the Divers, unaware of its
complexity and its lack of innocence, unaware that it was all a selection of
quality rather than quantity from the run of the world's bazaar; and that the
simplicity of behavior also, the nursery-like peace and good will, the emphasis
on the simpler virtues, was part of a desperate bargain with the gods and had
been attained through struggles she could not have guessed at. At that moment
the Divers represented externally the exact furthermost evolution of a class,
so that most people seemed awkward beside them--in reality a qualitative change
had already set in that was not at all apparent to Rosemary.
