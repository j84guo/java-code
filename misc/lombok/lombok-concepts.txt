/*******
Lombok :
********/

Lombok is a Java annotation library which aims to reduce developer boilerplate code. It creates getters/setters, constructors, equals and hashCode methods.
All you need to do is write the class and annotate its fields.

Getters and Setters :
At the method level, @Getter and @Setter generate standard getter and setter during compilation. At the class level, they do this for all non-static fields.
Final fields will not have setters.

Constructors :
@lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor - constructor for all final fields, use field order
@NoArgsConstructor - empty constructor
@AllArgsConstructor - constructor for all fields

Hash code and Equals :
@lombok.EqualsAndHashCode(of = {“number”, “text”}) - checks object logical equality based on the specified field types

To String :
@lombok.ToString - string representation of class, can exclude fields using parameter exclude="fieldName"

Logging :
Creates a logger field called log. The annotation is named based on the library used, @log4j, @slf4j 

Data
@lombok.Data - Combines @Getter, @Setter, @EqualsAndHashCode, @ToString, @RequiredArgsContructor
