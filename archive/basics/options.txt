Hi Kellie, my name is Jackson and I'd like to inquire about fall technology internships at Intelex. I study computer engineering at the University of Waterloo, have several software development co-ops under my belt and could help out the Intelex team! I'd be happy to provide you with more details of my experience through j84guo@edu.uwaterloo.ca or 226-808-6540. Thanks and have a great day.
